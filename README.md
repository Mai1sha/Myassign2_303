# Myassign2_303
For part1:
I am making my own single linked list which will push,pop values at both front and back. Return top and front value. It will check if my linked list is empty or not. My linked list will insert values at given index. It will take an index and remove value at that index.Also it will find me the index for given value.
I have used structure Node with template M and created a class(Sll) with template type "T" . All the memeber functions-push_front,push_back,insert,empty,pop_front,pop_back, find,remove and front,back are working fine with given values and index.

In the main, I have used an object for my class Sll.Using that object, I am calling the functions to operate.My functions are working fine to push,pop,insert and other operations.

For part2:
In this part,I have created a vector based stack.Using a template type,I have created a class(my_stack) and implemented functions like-empty,push_back, pop_back and top_stack.

In main, I have used an object for my stack.Using that object,I am calling my functions. My functions are working fine for all operations

To compile,
I have kept 3files, a header file for function declarations; a main for int main and a cpp for function implementation. I have included the file path in main and cpp. My program is running fine.
